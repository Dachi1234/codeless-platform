# 🚧 Placeholder & Incomplete Functionality

This document tracks **temporary/placeholder implementations** and **incomplete features** that need work before full production readiness.

**Last Updated**: October 9, 2025, 20:30  
**Deployment Status**: ✅ LIVE IN PRODUCTION (with known limitations)

---

## 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT READY (Working Placeholders)**

These placeholders are **functional enough for production** but can be improved:

### ✅ **Instructor Avatars**

**Files**: Course cards, course detail, dashboard  
**Current Implementation**: Uses `ui-avatars.com` API for generated avatars

**Status**: 🟢 PRODUCTION-READY  
**Why It's OK**: Looks professional, works reliably  
**Future Enhancement**: Upload real profile images via Cloudinary

---

### ✅ **PayPal Sandbox Mode**

**Files**: `backend/.../web/api/CheckoutController.java`, `PayPalService.java`  
**Current Implementation**: 
- Uses PayPal sandbox credentials
- Real PayPal API calls (not demo mode)
- Orders and captures work correctly
- Money stays in sandbox (not real)

**Status**: 🟡 PRODUCTION-READY (for testing)  
**What Works**:
- ✅ Order creation
- ✅ Payment capture
- ✅ Success/failure handling
- ✅ Webhook notifications

**To Enable Real PayPal**:
1. Get production credentials from https://developer.paypal.com
2. Update environment variables in Render:
   ```env
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_live_client_id
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_live_secret
   PAYPAL_BASE_URL=https://api-m.paypal.com  # Remove -m.sandbox
   ```
3. Test with small real payment first

**Impact**: LOW - Sandbox works for demos, switch to prod when ready for real sales

---

### ✅ **Progress Tracking (Fully Working)**

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED  
**What Works**:
- ✅ Lesson-level progress tracking
- ✅ Course-level progress aggregation
- ✅ Accurate lesson counts from curriculum
- ✅ Time spent tracking
- ✅ Completion percentages
- ✅ Real-time dashboard updates

**No Issues**: Fully functional! 🎉

---

### ✅ **Curriculum & Content (Fully Working)**

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE & DEPLOYED  
**What Works**:
- ✅ Course sections and lessons (database-driven)
- ✅ Video player (Plyr with YouTube/Vimeo/MP4)
- ✅ Article viewer (TinyMCE rich text)
- ✅ Quiz taker and grading
- ✅ Progress tracking
- ✅ Admin curriculum editor
- ✅ Admin article editor
- ✅ Admin quiz builder

**No Issues**: Fully functional! 🎉

## ⚠️ **SECURITY CONCERNS (Fix Before Production Sales)**

### ⚠️ **PayPal Webhook Signature Verification**

**File**: `backend/.../service/PayPalService.java` (Line ~130)

**Current Implementation**:
```java
private boolean verifyWebhookSignature(...) {
    log.warn("Webhook signature verification not yet implemented");
    return true; // INSECURE! Always returns true
}
```

**Status**: 🔴 **INSECURE**  
**Risk**: HIGH - Attackers could fake payment webhooks  
**Impact**: Could mark unpaid orders as paid

**To Fix**:
1. Implement PayPal webhook signature verification
2. Reference: https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/webhooks/
3. Verify `PAYPAL-TRANSMISSION-SIG` header
4. Use PayPal SDK or manual verification

**Priority**: 🔥 **CRITICAL** - Fix before accepting real payments
