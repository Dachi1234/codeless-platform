## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Frontend (Angular 19)**
- ✅ Standalone components
- ✅ Signals for reactive state
- ✅ Lazy loading (routes)
- ✅ HTTP interceptors (auth, API URL)
- ✅ Environment-based config
- ✅ Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- ✅ SCSS styling
- ✅ Angular Material (minimal)
- ✅ Plyr for video playback
- ✅ TinyMCE for rich text

### **Backend (Spring Boot 3.3.4)**
- ✅ RESTful APIs
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ Role-based authorization
- ✅ JPA/Hibernate (ORM)
- ✅ PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Flyway migrations
- ✅ DTOs for responses
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Environment variables

### **Database (PostgreSQL - Neon)**
- ✅ 20+ tables (normalized schema)
- ✅ Foreign keys and constraints
- ✅ Indexes on key columns
- ✅ Seed data (12 courses, roles, users)
- ✅ Flyway version control

### **Deployment**
- ✅ Frontend: Vercel (auto-deploy on Git push)
- ✅ Backend: Render (Docker, auto-deploy)
- ✅ Database: Neon (managed PostgreSQL)
- ✅ GitHub: Version control
- ✅ Environment variables (secure)
- ✅ HTTPS (SSL certificates)

---

## 📝 **Known Issues & Limitations**

### **Minor Issues**
1. ⚠️ Long Vercel URL (needs custom domain)
2. ⚠️ PayPal sandbox only (not production-ready)
3. ⚠️ No media upload (uses direct URLs)
4. ⚠️ No email service (password reset not functional)
5. ⚠️ Exercise Builder incomplete

### **Performance**
- ✅ Frontend: Fast (Angular SSR not needed for now)
- ✅ Backend: Good (Render free tier, may sleep after inactivity)
- ✅ Database: Fast (Neon pooling)
- ⚠️ First load: Render cold start (10-15s if sleeping)

### **Security**
- ✅ Passwords hashed (BCrypt)
- ✅ JWT tokens secure
- ✅ CORS configured
- ✅ SQL injection protected (JPA)
- ✅ XSS protection (Angular sanitization)
- ⚠️ No rate limiting (can be added)
- ⚠️ No HTTPS on backend (Render provides it)
