## 🐛 **Critical Issues Fixed (Oct 9, 2025 - Deployment Day)**

### **Issue 1: Frontend Not Connecting to Backend** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Checkout and API calls failing with "Failed to fetch"
- **Root Cause:** `fetch()` calls bypassing Angular HTTP interceptor, hardcoded `localhost:8080`
- **Solution:** Converted to `HttpClient`, created `api-url.interceptor.ts`
- **Files Changed:** `checkout.component.ts`, `api-url.interceptor.ts`, `app.config.ts`

### **Issue 2: Production Build Not Using environment.prod.ts** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Production build using dev config with empty `apiUrl`
- **Root Cause:** `package.json` build script missing `--configuration production` flag
- **Solution:** Updated build script to `ng build --configuration production`
- **Files Changed:** `package.json`, `angular.json`

### **Issue 3: Vercel Build Configuration** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Vercel not finding build output, 404 errors
- **Root Cause:** Wrong output directory path, missing root directory setting
- **Solution:** Set Root Directory to `frontend`, Output Directory to `dist/frontend/browser`
- **Files Changed:** Vercel project settings, `vercel.json`

### **Issue 4: CORS Blocking All Requests** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** 403 Forbidden on all API calls from production domain
- **Root Cause:** `SecurityConfig.java` had hardcoded `localhost:4200` CORS origin
- **Solution:** Inject `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable into `SecurityConfig`
- **Files Changed:** `SecurityConfig.java`
- **Impact:** This was THE critical bug - blocked everything!

### **Deployment Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ API URL interceptor for production backend
- ✅ Angular production configuration
- ✅ Vercel build settings (root directory, output directory)
- ✅ CORS environment variable injection
- ✅ Custom domain setup (codeless.digital)
- ✅ All features tested and working end-to-end
