# üóÑÔ∏è Database Scripts Reference

## **Deleted SQL Files Recap**

### **Permission Grant Scripts:**

1. **`grant_permissions_reviews.sql`**
   - Simple permission grant for `neondb_owner` and `codeless_user`
   - For both local and Neon

2. **`grant_permissions_reviews_generic.sql`**
   - Generic permissions with multiple options
   - For when you don't know your username
   - Had 3 options: current_user, PUBLIC, or specific user

3. **`fix_all_permissions_local.sql`**
   - Complete permissions for LOCAL PostgreSQL
   - Granted to codeless_user, postgres, and PUBLIC
   - Included verification queries

   - Included verification queries

5. **`fix_local_permissions.sql`**
   - Most comprehensive local fix
   - Included test insert/delete
   - Full permission verification

### **Debugging Script:**

6. **`debug_reviews.sql`**
   - Show all reviews with user/course names
   - Count reviews per course
   - Check course rating fields
   - Verify all permissions (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

### **Other:**

7. **`add_admin_role.sql`**
   - Old script for adding ADMIN role to users
   - Probably not related to reviews

## ‚úÖ **Good News:**

The **important fix is already applied** in your code:
- ‚úÖ `CourseReviewRepository.java` - JOIN FETCH queries (fixes LazyInitializationException)
- ‚úÖ `CourseReviewService.java` - Admin bypass for enrollment check
- ‚úÖ Database permissions already granted (you ran them in pgAdmin)

## üìù **What You Need:**

If you need to grant permissions again (for Neon or fresh database), just run this in SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Quick fix for any database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLE course_reviews TO current_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SEQUENCE course_reviews_id_seq TO current_user;
```

That's all you need! The scripts were helpers, but not critical since you've already fixed everything. üéâ
