# Course Enhancement Summary - October 7, 2025

## 🎯 Problem
The Course table was too basic - missing essential e-learning platform fields like:
- Instructor information
- Ratings & reviews
- Course duration & lesson count
- Start/end dates for LIVE courses
- Original price (for discounts)
- Course level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Categories and tags
- And more...

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Enhanced Course Entity
**File**: `backend/codeless-backend/src/main/java/com/codeless/backend/domain/Course.java`

**New Fields Added**:
```java
// Pricing
- originalPrice          // Show discounts (was $149, now $89)

// Instructor
- instructorName         // "Sarah Johnson"
- instructorTitle        // "Senior Developer at Google"
- instructorAvatarUrl    // Profile picture URL

// Metadata
- level                  // BEGINNER, INTERMEDIATE, ADVANCED, ALL_LEVELS
- rating                 // 4.8 out of 5
- reviewCount            // 2,847 reviews

// Course Content
- lessonCount            // 245 lessons
- durationHours          // 40 hours of content

// LIVE Course Fields
- startDate              // Feb 15, 2024
- endDate                // March 28, 2024
- sessionCount           // 12 live sessions
- maxStudents            // Max 50 students
- enrolledCount          // Currently 37 enrolled

// Publishing
- published              // true/false
- featured               // Featured courses on homepage
- category               // "Development", "Marketing", etc.
- tags                   // Comma-separated for search
- updatedAt              // Track updates
```

### 2. Database Migration
**File**: `backend/codeless-backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V7__enhance_courses_and_seed_data.sql`

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Adds all new columns to `course` table
2. ✅ Adds unique constraint on `slug`
3. ✅ Clears old incomplete course data
4. ✅ Seeds **12 realistic courses** with complete data:
   - 7 PRE-RECORDED courses (Web Dev, Python, UI/UX, AWS, etc.)
   - 3 LIVE courses (Digital Marketing, Bootcamp, Product Management)
   - 2 BUNDLE courses (Developer Bundle, Business Bundle)
5. ✅ Adds performance indexes for filtering

### 3. Updated DTOs
**File**: `backend/codeless-backend/src/main/java/com/codeless/backend/web/api/dto/CourseDTO.java`

Now includes all 24 fields from the Course entity.

### 4. Frontend Course Type
**File**: `frontend/src/app/services/course.service.ts`

Updated `Course` type to match backend DTO with all new fields.
