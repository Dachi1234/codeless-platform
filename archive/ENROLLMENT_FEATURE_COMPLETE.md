## ✅ Enrollment Feature - Complete Implementation

### What Was Built

I've successfully implemented the full enrollment flow for your Codeless course platform!

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **EnrollmentService** (`frontend/src/app/services/enrollment.service.ts`)
- `enroll(courseId)` - Enroll user in a course
- `getMyEnrollments()` - Fetch all user enrollments
- `isEnrolled(courseId)` - Check if user is already enrolled
- Full TypeScript typing for requests/responses

### 2. **Auth Guard** (`frontend/src/app/guards/auth.guard.ts`)
- Protects routes that require authentication
- Redirects to login with return URL
- Applied to `/my-courses` and `/checkout` routes

### 3. **"Enroll Now" Button** (Course Detail Page)
**Smart Functionality:**
- **Not logged in**: Redirects to login (with return URL to come back)
- **Logged in**: Enrolls user in the course
- **Already enrolled**: Shows "Already Enrolled" (disabled button)
- **Enrolling**: Shows "Enrolling..." loading state
- **Success**: Shows success message
- **Error**: Shows error message (duplicate enrollment, network error, etc.)

**Features:**
- Checks enrollment status on page load
- Handles 409 Conflict (already enrolled)
- Real-time button state management
- Success/error notifications

### 4. **My Courses Page** (`/my-courses`)
**Features:**
- Protected route (requires login)
- Displays all user's enrolled courses
- Stats cards: Enrolled, In Progress, Completed
- Empty state with "Browse Courses" CTA
- Loading state
- Reuses `CourseCardComponent` for consistency

### 5. **Header Navigation Updates**
- Added "My Courses" link (only visible when logged in)
- Shows in both desktop nav and mobile hamburger menu
- Book icon for visual consistency

### 6. **Styling**
- Success/error messages on course detail sidebar
- My Courses page complete styling
- Empty state design
- Stats cards
- Responsive grid layout
- Disabled button state

## 🧪 How to Test

### Test Enrollment Flow (Full Journey):

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend/codeless-backend
   .\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npx ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
   ```

2. **Test as Guest:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:4200/courses/1`
   - Click "Enroll Now"
   - ✅ Should redirect to login with `returnUrl=/courses/1`

3. **Test Registration:**
   - On login page, click "Sign up"
   - Register a new account
   - ✅ Should be logged in and redirected to `/courses`

4. **Test Enrollment:**
   - Navigate to any course (e.g., `/courses/1`)
   - Click "Enroll Now"
   - ✅ Should see "Enrolling..." then success message
   - ✅ Button should change to "Already Enrolled" (disabled)

5. **Test My Courses:**
   - Click "My Courses" in header
   - ✅ Should see your enrolled course(s)
   - ✅ Should see stats (1 Enrolled, 1 In Progress, 0 Completed)

6. **Test Duplicate Enrollment:**
   - Go to the same course again
   - ✅ Button should already show "Already Enrolled"
   - Click it anyway
   - ✅ Should show error: "You are already enrolled"

7. **Test Auth Guard:**
   - Logout
   - Try to navigate to `/my-courses` directly
   - ✅ Should redirect to login

8. **Test Multiple Enrollments:**
   - Enroll in multiple courses
   - Go to "My Courses"
   - ✅ Should see all your enrollments

## 🔌 Backend Integration

The frontend integrates with these backend endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------|---------|
| `/api/enrollments` | POST | ✅ | Enroll user in course |
| `/api/enrollments` | GET | ✅ | Get user's enrollments |

**Request Example:**
```json
POST /api/enrollments
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "courseId": 1
}
```

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "userId": 5,
  "courseId": 1,
  "enrolledAt": "2025-10-01T18:30:00Z",
  "message": "Successfully enrolled"
}
```

**Error Response (409 Conflict):**
```json
{
  "message": "User is already enrolled in this course"
}
```
