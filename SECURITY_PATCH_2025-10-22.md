# Security Patch - October 22, 2025

## üîê Critical Security Fix: Admin Role Enforcement

**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed  
**Issue**: Admin endpoints were not properly protected on the backend

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Security Configuration
**File**: `backend/codeless-backend/src/main/java/com/codeless/backend/config/SecurityConfig.java`

#### Added Method-Level Security
```diff
+ import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration.EnableMethodSecurity;

  @Configuration
  @EnableWebSecurity
+ @EnableMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
  public class SecurityConfig {
```

#### Added Path-Based Admin Protection
```diff
  .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
      .requestMatchers("/api/auth/**").permitAll()
      .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/api/courses/**").permitAll()
+     .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.GET, "/api/articles/**").permitAll()
      .requestMatchers("/api/cart/guest/**").permitAll()
      
+     // CRITICAL: All /api/admin/** endpoints require ADMIN role
+     .requestMatchers("/api/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
      
      // Course management requires ADMIN role
      .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/api/courses/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
      .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.PUT, "/api/courses/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
+     .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.PATCH, "/api/courses/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
      .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.DELETE, "/api/courses/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
      
+     // Article management requires ADMIN role
+     .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.POST, "/api/articles/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
+     .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.PUT, "/api/articles/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
+     .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.PATCH, "/api/articles/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
+     .requestMatchers(HttpMethod.DELETE, "/api/articles/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
      
      .anyRequest().authenticated()
  )
```

### 2. Documentation Added

#### New Files Created
- `docs/architecture/BACKEND_SECURITY_AUDIT.md` - Comprehensive security audit report
- `docs/setup/SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step testing guide with 11 test cases
- `docs/SECURITY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference guide
- `SECURITY_PATCH_2025-10-22.md` - This file

## Verification Steps

### Before This Patch (Vulnerable)
```bash
# Regular user could access admin endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer REGULAR_USER_TOKEN"
# Result: 200 OK ‚ùå (BAD!)
```

### After This Patch (Secure)
```bash
# Regular user is now properly blocked
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer REGULAR_USER_TOKEN"
# Result: 403 Forbidden ‚úÖ (GOOD!)
```

---

## Protected Endpoints

All the following endpoints now require `ROLE_ADMIN`:

### Admin Panel Endpoints
- `/api/admin/dashboard/**` - Dashboard statistics
- `/api/admin/courses/**` - Course management (CRUD)
- `/api/admin/users/**` - User management
- `/api/admin/orders/**` - Order management & refunds
- `/api/admin/enrollments/**` - Enrollment tracking
- `/api/admin/quizzes/**` - Quiz management
- `/api/admin/articles/**` - Article content management
- `/api/admin/sessions/**` - Live session management
- `/api/admin/assignments/**` - Assignment management
- `/api/admin/submissions/**` - Submission grading

### Course Management (Outside Admin Panel)
- `POST /api/courses/**` - Create courses
- `PUT /api/courses/**` - Update courses
- `PATCH /api/courses/**` - Partial update courses
- `DELETE /api/courses/**` - Delete courses

### Article Management
- `POST /api/articles/**` - Create articles
- `PUT /api/articles/**` - Update articles
- `PATCH /api/articles/**` - Partial update articles
- `DELETE /api/articles/**` - Delete articles

---

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
```bash
# 1. Get a regular user token
USER_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"user@test.com","password":"test123"}' \
  | jq -r '.token')

# 2. Try to access admin endpoint (should fail)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  -i
# Expected: HTTP 403 Forbidden

# 3. Get an admin token
ADMIN_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@test.com","password":"admin123"}' \
  | jq -r '.token')

# 4. Try with admin token (should succeed)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/admin/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -i
# Expected: HTTP 200 OK
```

### Full Test Suite
See `docs/setup/SECURITY_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing.

## How to Grant Admin Role

```sql
-- Grant admin role to a user
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role_id)
VALUES (
    (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'your@email.com'),
    (SELECT id FROM roles WHERE name = 'ROLE_ADMIN')
);
```

---

## Impact Assessment

### Risk Level: CRITICAL
- **Before**: Any authenticated user could perform admin actions
- **After**: Only users with ROLE_ADMIN can perform admin actions

### Affected Systems
- ‚úÖ Backend API (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Admin Panel Access (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Course Management (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ User Management (Fixed)
- ‚úÖ Order Management (Fixed)

### Breaking Changes
- None. Regular users never should have had admin access.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert the following changes:

```diff
- @EnableMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
+ // @EnableMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
```

And remove the added path matchers. However, this will **reintroduce the security vulnerability**.
