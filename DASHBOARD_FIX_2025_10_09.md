# 🐛 Dashboard Fix - Courses Not Showing

**Date**: October 9, 2025  
**Issue**: Users couldn't see their enrolled courses on the dashboard

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The dashboard was filtering courses by "In Progress" tab by default, which only showed courses with `completionPercentage > 0 && completionPercentage < 100`. 

**Problem**: Newly enrolled courses have `completionPercentage === 0`, so they were being filtered out!

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Frontend Filter Logic** (`dashboard.component.ts`)

**Before**:
```typescript
getFilteredCourses(): CourseProgress[] {
  if (this.activeTab === 'in-progress') {
    // Only showed courses with progress > 0%
    return this.coursesWithProgress.filter(c => 
      c.completionPercentage > 0 && c.completionPercentage < 100
    );
  }
  // ...
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
getFilteredCourses(): CourseProgress[] {
  if (this.activeTab === 'in-progress') {
    // Show ALL courses that are NOT completed (including 0%)
    return this.coursesWithProgress.filter(c => 
      c.completionPercentage < 100
    );
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Rationale**: "In Progress" should include newly enrolled courses (0%) as well as partially completed courses (1-99%).

### 2. **Backend Default Progress** (`DashboardService.java`)

**Before**:
```java
var defaultProgress = new CourseProgress();
// id was null, causing potential serialization issues
```

**After**:
```java
var defaultProgress = new CourseProgress();
defaultProgress.setId(0L); // Temporary ID for non-persisted progress
defaultProgress.setLessonCompleted(0);
defaultProgress.setLessonTotal(enrollment.getCourse().getLessonCount());
defaultProgress.setTimeSpentSeconds(0L);
defaultProgress.setCompletionPercentage(0);
defaultProgress.setLastAccessedAt(null);
```

**Rationale**: Ensure all fields are properly initialized, including a temporary ID for non-persisted progress records.

---

### 3. **Added Debug Logging** (`dashboard.component.ts`)

```typescript
this.dashboardService.getCoursesWithProgress().subscribe({
  next: (courses) => {
    console.log('[Dashboard] Loaded courses with progress:', courses);
    this.coursesWithProgress = courses;
    console.log('[Dashboard] Active tab:', this.activeTab);
    console.log('[Dashboard] Filtered courses:', this.getFilteredCourses());
  },
  error: (err) => {
    console.error('[Dashboard] Error loading courses with progress:', err);
    console.error('[Dashboard] Error details:', err.error);
  }
});
```

**Rationale**: Help diagnose future issues by logging the data flow.

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Newly Enrolled Course
1. Enroll in a new course
2. Go to dashboard
3. **Expected**: Course appears in "In Progress" tab with 0% progress
4. **Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Scenario 2: Partially Completed Course
1. Start watching a video lesson (don't finish)
2. Go to dashboard
3. **Expected**: Course shows actual progress (e.g., 1/12 lessons, 8%)
4. **Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Scenario 3: Completed Course
1. Complete all lessons in a course
2. Go to dashboard
3. **Expected**: Course appears in "Completed" tab with 100%
4. **Result**: ✅ PASS

### Test Scenario 4: Tab Filtering
1. Switch between "In Progress", "Completed", and "All" tabs
2. **Expected**: Correct courses show in each tab
3. **Result**: ✅ PASS

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Filter Logic**: When filtering by "in progress", consider that 0% is still "in progress"
2. **Default Values**: Always initialize all fields when creating default objects
3. **Debug Logging**: Add logging early to catch issues faster
4. **User Perspective**: Test from the user's perspective, not just the developer's

## ✅ Status

**FIXED** - Courses now display correctly on dashboard for all progress states (0%, 1-99%, 100%)
