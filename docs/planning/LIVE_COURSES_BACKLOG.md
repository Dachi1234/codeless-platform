## üìñ **PRODUCT VISION**

### **What is a Live Course?**
A Live Course is a scheduled, instructor-led learning experience where students join real-time sessions via Zoom. Unlike self-paced courses (video/article/quiz), Live Courses have:
- **Fixed schedule** (start date, end date, session times)
- **Live interactive sessions** (Zoom meetings)
- **Limited capacity** (max students)
- **Shared materials** (files uploaded during/after sessions)
- **Live quizzes** (taken during sessions)
- **Student submissions** (homework, projects)
- **Session recordings** (for review after live)

### **User Types:**
1. **Admin/Instructor**: Creates course, schedules sessions, uploads materials, grades submissions
2. **Student**: Enrolls, attends sessions, takes quizzes, uploads work, reviews recordings
